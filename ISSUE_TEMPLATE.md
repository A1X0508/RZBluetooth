### Bluetooth Logs
If your issue is related to bluetooth communication, please include logs gathered with `RZBSetLogHandler`. Be aware that the log may contain sensitive information, and you may want to obfuscate the log. If you ignore the log levels `RZBLogLevelWriteCommandData` and `RZBLogLevelDelegateValue`, none of the transmitted NSData is included in the log.
